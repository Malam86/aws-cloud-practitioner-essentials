## 🗂️ Introduction to Storage Types

### 💾 Block Storage

**What is Block Storage?**
- Storage that acts like a physical hard drive for your EC2 instances
- Data is stored in fixed-sized "blocks"
- Provides low-latency, high-performance storage

**Real-World Analogy:**

Block Storage = Like having a physical hard drive for your computer

You can install the operating system

You can store programs and files

It's directly attached to your computer


**AWS Block Storage Services:**

#### 1. Amazon EC2 Instance Store
**Meaning:** Temporary, high-speed storage directly attached to your EC2 instance.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Non-persistent** - Data is lost if instance stops or terminates
- **High performance** - Very fast for temporary data
- **Free** - Included with EC2 instance

**Use Cases:**
- 🚀 **Temporary cache** files
- 📊 **Buffer** for processing
- 🔄 **Scratch space** for calculations

**Example: Video Processing**
Video editing application:
├── EC2 Instance Store: Temporary video frames during editing
├── Fast access for real-time processing
└── Final video saved to persistent storage

#### 2. Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
**Meaning:** Persistent, managed block storage that stays even if EC2 instance stops.

**Key Characteristics:**

**Example: Web Server**
Web server with EBS:
├── EBS Volume: Contains OS, web server software, website files
├── If server crashes: Launch new instance and attach same EBS volume
└── All data preserved

### 📦 Object Storage

**What is Object Storage?**
- Stores data as "objects" with metadata
- Unlimited scalability - can store massive amounts of data
- Flat structure - no folders or directories
- Accessed via APIs

**Real-World Analogy:**

Object Storage = Like a giant warehouse with infinite shelves

Each item (object) has a unique ID and description (metadata)

You can store billions of items

You find items by their ID, not by shelf location


**AWS Object Storage Service:**

#### Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
**Meaning:** Fully managed object storage for any amount of data.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Unlimited scaling** - Store as much as you want
- **99.999999999% durability** - Extremely reliable
- **Web interface** - Easy to use
- **Multiple storage classes** - Different costs for different access patterns

**Use Cases:**

Photo sharing app using S3:
├── Users upload photos → Stored in S3
├── App retrieves photos from S3 when needed
├── Automatic scaling for millions of users
└── Cost-effective for storage

### 📁 File Storage

**What is File Storage?**
- Shared storage that multiple users/computers can access simultaneously
- Organized in folders and directories
- Uses standard file protocols (NFS, SMB)

**Real-World Analogy:**

File Storage = Like a shared network drive in an office

Multiple employees can access the same files

Organized in folders everyone understands

Changes are visible to everyone immediately


**AWS File Storage Services:**

#### 1. Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)
**Meaning:** Managed network file system that multiple EC2 instances can share.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **NFS protocol** - Standard network file system
- **Fully managed** - No provisioning needed

**Use Cases:**
- 👥 **Team projects** with shared files
- 🎬 **Media rendering** farms
- 🔬 **Scientific research** data

**Example: Video Editing Team**

Video production team:
├── Multiple editors working on same project
├── EFS stores all video files and project files
├── All editors see latest changes instantly
└── No file conflicts or version issues

#### 2. Amazon FSx
**Meaning:** Managed file storage for specific operating systems and applications.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Windows File Server** - For Windows environments

## 🔒 AWS Shared Responsibility for Storage

### Three Categories of Responsibility:

#### 1. Fully Managed Services
**AWS Responsibility:** Everything from hardware to storage software
**Your Responsibility:** Data management and access controls

**Examples:**
- **Amazon S3** - AWS handles durability, availability, encryption
- **Amazon EFS** - AWS manages file system infrastructure

#### 2. Managed Services
**AWS Responsibility:** Infrastructure and basic operations
**Your Responsibility:** Backups, encryption setup, performance tuning

**Examples:**
- **Amazon EBS** - AWS manages hardware, you manage snapshots and performance
- **Amazon FSx** - AWS manages file server, you manage shares and access

#### 3. Unmanaged Services
**AWS Responsibility:** Only the physical hardware
**Your Responsibility:** Everything else - backups, security, performance

**Examples:**
- **EC2 Instance Store** - You manage everything about the storage

# EBS Snapshots - Exam Focus Notes

## 🎯 WHAT ARE EBS SNAPSHOTS?
**Definition:** Point-in-time backups of EBS volumes

### Key Characteristics:
- **Incremental Backups:** Only saves blocks that changed since last snapshot
- **Stored in S3:** Snapshots are stored in Amazon S3 (not in EBS)
- **Cross-AZ Redundancy:** Automatically stored across multiple Availability Zones
- **Exact Copies:** New volumes from snapshots = identical to original volume

### 🧠 EXAM TIP:
"EBS snapshots are stored in S3" is a common exam question. Remember:
- EBS volumes = block storage in specific AZ
- EBS snapshots = object storage in S3 (regional)

## 🔄 HOW SNAPSHOTS WORK - VISUALIZE THIS:
Day 1: Volume [Block A][Block B][Block C][Block D] → Snapshot 1 (all blocks)
Day 2: Volume [Block A][Block B][Block C][Block E] → Snapshot 2 (only Block E)
Day 3: Volume [Block A][Block F][Block C][Block E] → Snapshot 3 (only Block F)


**Key Insight:** Each snapshot only stores the CHANGED blocks, making them:
- **Cost-effective** (you don't pay for duplicate data)
- **Faster** (only transfer changes)

## ⚖️ SHARED RESPONSIBILITY - CUSTOMER DUTIES:

### YOU Are Responsible For:
✅ **Scheduling snapshots** (AWS doesn't do this automatically)
✅ **Managing retention** (how long to keep snapshots)
✅ **Cost monitoring** (deleting old snapshots to save money)
✅ **Encryption** of sensitive data in snapshots
✅ **Testing restoration** procedures regularly
✅ **Verifying integrity** of snapshots

### AWS Is Responsible For:
✅ Storing snapshots securely in S3
✅ Maintaining infrastructure reliability
✅ Ensuring snapshot durability across AZs
