Module 6: Storage on AWS
üíæ Introduction to AWS Storage Services
üéØ Why Storage Matters in Cloud Computing
Meaning: Storage services allow you to store, access, and manage data in the AWS cloud, providing durability, availability, and scalability for your applications.

Key Concept: Different types of data need different types of storage solutions, just like you use different containers for different items in your kitchen.

üóÇÔ∏è AWS Storage Services Overview
1. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Meaning: Object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

Key Characteristics:

Object-based storage - stores data as objects in buckets

Virtually unlimited scalability

99.999999999% durability (11 nines)

99.99% availability

Web-based interface for easy access

2. Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)
Meaning: Block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances, providing persistent storage that persists independently from instance life.

Key Characteristics:

Block-level storage - like hard drives

Attached to EC2 instances

Persistent storage - survives instance termination

Multiple volume types for different workloads

3. Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)
Meaning: Scalable, elastic, cloud-native file storage that can be shared across multiple EC2 instances.

Key Characteristics:

File-level storage - like network drives

Shared access - multiple instances can access simultaneously

Elastic scaling - grows and shrinks automatically

Fully managed - no provisioning required

4. Amazon Glacier
Meaning: Low-cost storage service for data archiving and long-term backup.

Key Characteristics:

Extremely low cost for archival data

Multiple retrieval options (minutes to hours)

Secure and durable

Ideal for compliance and regulatory data

üéØ Choosing the Right Storage Service
Storage Decision Matrix:
Storage Need	Recommended Service	Why
Website files, backups	Amazon S3	Scalable, durable, cost-effective
Database storage	Amazon EBS	High performance, low latency
Shared application files	Amazon EFS	Multiple instances access same files
Long-term archives	Amazon Glacier	Lowest cost for infrequent access
Disaster recovery	Combination	S3 for backup, Glacier for archives
üí∞ Storage Pricing Models
Cost Considerations:
Storage capacity (per GB per month)

Data transfer (in/out of AWS)

Requests (number of read/write operations)

Retrieval fees (for archival storage)

Cost Optimization Strategies:
Choose appropriate storage class for access patterns

Use lifecycle policies to move data to cheaper tiers

Compress data before storage

Use appropriate redundancy levels

üõ°Ô∏è Storage Security
Security Features:
Encryption at rest (AWS KMS, customer keys)

Encryption in transit (SSL/TLS)

Access controls (IAM policies, bucket policies)

Versioning and MFA delete

Access logging and monitoring

üîÑ Data Management
Backup and Recovery:
Automated snapshots for EBS volumes

Cross-region replication for S3

Versioning for object recovery

Lifecycle policies for cost management

Data Transfer:
AWS Snow Family for large-scale data transfer

DataSync for automated data transfer

Transfer Acceleration for faster uploads

üß™ Hands-On Practice
Created S3 bucket and uploaded files

Configured EBS volumes for EC2 instances

Set up EFS file system for shared storage

Implemented S3 lifecycle policies
