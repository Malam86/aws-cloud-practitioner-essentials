# Module 3: Exploring Compute Services

## üöÄ Beyond EC2: AWS Compute Spectrum

AWS offers a range of compute services beyond EC2, each designed for specific use cases.

### 1. AWS Lambda (Serverless Compute)
**Meaning:** Event-driven compute service that runs code without provisioning servers.

**Key Characteristics:**
- No server management
- Automatic scaling
- Pay-per-use pricing
- Stateless execution

**Example Use Cases:**
- Real-time file processing
- Web backends via API Gateway
- Data stream processing

### 2. AWS Container Services
#### Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)
**Meaning:** Fully managed container orchestration service.

#### Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)  
**Meaning:** Managed Kubernetes service.

#### AWS Fargate
**Meaning:** Serverless compute engine for containers.

### 3. AWS Elastic Beanstalk
**Meaning:** Service for deploying and scaling web applications.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Multiple language support
- Built-in monitoring
- Simplified deployment

## ‚öñÔ∏è Choosing the Right Compute Service

| Service | Best For | Management Level |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| **EC2** | Full control | High |
| **Lambda** | Event-driven tasks | None |
| **Containers** | Microservices | Medium |
| **Fargate** | Serverless containers | Low |
| **Beanstalk** | Web apps | Low |
