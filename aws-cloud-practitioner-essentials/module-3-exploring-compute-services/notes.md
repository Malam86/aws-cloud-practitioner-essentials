# Module 3: Exploring Compute Services

## üåê Introduction to Serverless Computing

### ü§ñ Managed vs. Unmanaged Services

**Unmanaged Services (Infrastructure-as-a-Service - IaaS):**
**Meaning:** Cloud services where you manage the operating system, runtime, and application code, while the cloud provider manages the underlying hardware and virtualization.

**Key Characteristics:**
- You manage: OS, middleware, runtime, application code
- Cloud provider manages: Hardware, networking, storage, virtualization
- Requires system administration knowledge
- More control but more responsibility

**Examples:**
- **Amazon EC2:** You manage the OS, software, and applications on virtual servers
- **Self-managed databases:** Installing MySQL/MongoDB on EC2 instances
- **Custom applications:** Running your own software stack on virtual machines

**Real-world analogy:** Renting an empty apartment (you furnish it, maintain it, but don't worry about the building structure)

**Fully-Managed Services (Platform-as-a-Service - PaaS/Serverless):**
**Meaning:** Cloud services where the cloud provider manages everything from the infrastructure to the runtime environment, and you only manage your application code and data.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Cloud provider manages: Infrastructure, OS, runtime, scaling, patching
- You manage: Application code and data
- No server management required
- Automatic scaling and high availability
- Pay-per-use pricing model

**Examples:**
- **AWS Lambda:** Run code without provisioning servers
- **Amazon RDS:** Managed relational database service
- **Amazon S3:** Managed object storage service
- **AWS Fargate:** Serverless compute for containers
- **Amazon DynamoDB:** Managed NoSQL database

**Real-world analogy:** Staying in a hotel (everything is maintained for you, you just use the facilities)

## üéØ Fully-Managed Services Deep Dive

### What Makes a Service "Fully-Managed"?

**Meaning:** A service where AWS handles all the undifferentiated heavy lifting of infrastructure management, including:

1. **Provisioning:** Automatic resource allocation
2. **Scaling:** Automatic adjustment to workload demands
3. **Maintenance:** OS patching, security updates, hardware repairs
4. **Availability:** Built-in redundancy and failover
5. **Backups:** Automated backup and recovery systems
6. **Monitoring:** Built-in health checks and performance monitoring

### AWS Fully-Managed Services Examples:

#### 1. Compute Services

- **AWS Fargate:** Run containers without managing servers
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk:** Deploy web applications easily

#### 2. Database Services
- **Amazon RDS:** Managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- **Amazon DynamoDB:** Managed NoSQL database
- **Amazon Aurora:** MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database

#### 3. Storage Services

   - Built-in compliance certifications
   - Example: Automatic SSL certificate management

5. **Faster Time-to-Market:**
   - Focus on code, not infrastructure
   - Rapid deployment capabilities
   - Example: Deploy Lambda functions in seconds

### When to Choose Fully-Managed Services:

**Choose managed services when:**
- You want to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure
- You need automatic scaling and high availability
- You have limited DevOps resources
- You want predictable operational costs
- You need rapid deployment and iteration

**Choose unmanaged services when:**
- You need full control over the environment
- You have specific compliance requirements
- You need custom configurations not supported by managed services
- You have existing investments in specific technologies

## üîÑ Serverless Computing Pattern

**Traditional Approach:**

Your Code ‚Üí Your Runtime ‚Üí Your OS ‚Üí Your Server ‚Üí Physical Hardware

**Serverless Approach:**

Your Code ‚Üí Managed Runtime ‚Üí Managed Infrastructure

**Key Shift in Responsibility:**
- **You manage:** Application code and business logic
- **AWS manages:** Everything else (servers, OS, runtime, scaling, security)

## üí° Real-World Use Cases

### Startup Company:
- **Challenge:** Limited IT staff, need to focus on product development
- **Solution:** Use Lambda for backend, S3 for storage, DynamoDB for database
- **Result:** No server management, automatic scaling, pay-only-for-use

### Enterprise Application:
- **Challenge:** Seasonal traffic spikes, need high availability
- **Solution:** Use Fargate for containers, RDS for database, ELB for load balancing
- **Result:** Handles traffic spikes automatically, 99.99% availability

### Data Processing Pipeline:
- **Challenge:** Process large volumes of data efficiently
- **Solution:** Use Lambda for transformation, S3 for storage, Athena for querying
- **Result:** Serverless data pipeline that scales with data volume

## üöÄ Beyond EC2: AWS Compute Spectrum

AWS offers a range of compute services beyond EC2, each designed for specific use cases.

### 1. AWS Lambda (Serverless Compute)
**Meaning:** Event-driven compute service that runs code without provisioning servers.

**Key Characteristics:**
- No server management
- Automatic scaling
- Pay-per-use pricing
- Stateless execution

**Example Use Cases:**
- Real-time file processing
- Web backends via API Gateway
- Data stream processing

## ‚ö° AWS Lambda: Serverless Compute Service

### ü§î What is AWS Lambda?

**Meaning:** AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically executes your code in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources for you.

**Key Concept:** Instead of maintaining servers that run 24/7, Lambda runs your code only when needed, and you pay only for the compute time you consume.

### üîÑ How Lambda Works: The 3-Step Process

#### 1. Trigger (Event Source)
**Meaning:** An event that initiates the execution of your Lambda function. Lambda functions are event-driven - they don't run continuously but only when triggered.

**Common Triggers:**
- **API Gateway:** HTTP requests to your API
- **S3 Bucket:** File uploads, modifications, or deletions
- **DynamoDB:** Database table changes
- **SNS/SQS:** Messages from notification or queue services
- **CloudWatch Events:** Scheduled events (cron jobs)
- **Kinesis:** Data streams from various sources

**Example:** A user uploads a photo to an S3 bucket ‚Üí This triggers a Lambda function

#### 2. Run Code (Execution)
**Meaning:** Lambda executes your code in a secure, isolated environment called an execution environment.

**Execution Process:**
- Lambda creates an execution environment with your function code
- The environment includes the runtime, your code, and any dependencies
- Your function runs and processes the event data
- Returns a response (if applicable)

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Stateless:** Each invocation is independent (no memory of previous runs)
- **Ephemeral:** Execution environments are temporary
- **Isolated:** Secure separation between function executions

**Example:** The Lambda function resizes the uploaded photo and creates thumbnails

#### 3. Pay Only for Compute Time Used (Pricing)
**Meaning:** You pay only for the actual compute time your code consumes, measured in millisecond increments.

**Pricing Components:**
- **Request pricing:** $0.20 per 1 million requests
- **Compute pricing:** $0.0000166667 per GB-second
- **Free tier:** 1 million free requests and 400,000 GB-seconds per month

**Cost Example:**
- Function uses 128MB memory
- Runs for 1 second
- Cost: $0.0000000021 per invocation
- 1 million invocations would cost ~$2.10

### üéØ Lambda Use Cases: Real-World Examples
