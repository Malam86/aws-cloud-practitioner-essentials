# Module 2: Compute in the Cloud

## 🌐 What is Cloud Compute?
Compute refers to the processing power required to run applications, manage data, and perform calculations.

## 🏗️ Amazon EC2 Instance Types

| Instance Type | Purpose | Ideal Workloads |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| **General Purpose** | Balanced compute, memory, and networking | Web servers, small databases, development environments 
| **Compute Optimized** | High-performance processors | Batch processing, scientific modeling, gaming servers 
| **Memory Optimized** | Process large datasets in memory | In-memory databases, big data processing 
| **Storage Optimized** | High, sequential read/write access to large datasets | Data warehousing, distributed file systems 
| **Accelerated Computing** | Hardware accelerators (e.g., GPUs) | Graphics processing, machine learning 

## 🤝 Multi-Tenancy in Cloud Computing
Multi-tenancy is a fundamental cloud architecture where multiple customers (tenants) share the same physical infrastructure while maintaining logical isolation of their data and applications.

## 💡 Key Concepts
- **Scalability**: The ability to easily increase or decrease compute resources based on demand.
- **Elasticity**: The ability to acquire resources as you need them and release them when you don't.

## 🛠️ Hands-On Practice
- Launched a `t2.micro` EC2 instance (Free Tier eligible).
- Explored the EC2 dashboard and instance details.
