# Module 2: Compute in the Cloud

## üåê What is Cloud Compute?
Compute refers to the processing power required to run applications, manage data, and perform calculations.

## üèóÔ∏è Amazon EC2 Instance Types

| Instance Type | Purpose | Ideal Workloads |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| **General Purpose** | Balanced compute, memory, and networking | Web servers, small databases, development environments 
| **Compute Optimized** | High-performance processors | Batch processing, scientific modeling, gaming servers 
| **Memory Optimized** | Process large datasets in memory | In-memory databases, big data processing 
| **Storage Optimized** | High, sequential read/write access to large datasets | Data warehousing, distributed file systems 
| **Accelerated Computing** | Hardware accelerators (e.g., GPUs) | Graphics processing, machine learning 

## üñ•Ô∏è Methods to Interact with AWS Services

AWS provides three main ways to interact with their services:

| Method | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **AWS Management Console** | Web-based graphical interface for point-and-click management | Beginners, manual operations, visual learners |
| **AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)** | Command-line tool for scripting and automation | Developers, automated tasks, repetitive operations |
| **AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs)** | Language-specific libraries for integrating AWS into applications | Application development, custom solutions, programmers |

### Key Differences:
- **Console**: Visual, no coding required
- **CLI**: Scriptable, command-based
- **SDKs**: Programmatic, integrated into application code

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Compute Services

**Compute** refers to the on-demand processing capacity that runs applications in the AWS cloud. Instead of physical servers, AWS provides virtualized, scalable resources.

**Main AWS Compute Services:**
- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Virtual servers with full control
- **Lambda**: Serverless functions that run code without provisioning servers
- **ECS/EKS**: Container management services
- **Fargate**: Serverless compute for containers
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: Automated deployment and scaling of web apps

## üîê AWS Shared Responsibility Model

The Shared Responsibility Model defines security responsibilities between AWS and customers:

**AWS is responsible for security OF the cloud:**
- Global infrastructure security
- Hardware and software maintenance
- Host operating system and virtualization
- Physical data center security

**Customer is responsible for security IN the cloud:**
- Guest operating system management
- Application security and data encryption
- Security group and firewall configurations
- IAM user access and permissions
- Network traffic protection

## ü§ù Multi-Tenancy in Cloud Computing
Multi-tenancy is a fundamental cloud architecture where multiple customers (tenants) share the same physical infrastructure while maintaining logical isolation of their data and applications.

## üí° Key Concepts
- **Scalability**: The ability to easily increase or decrease compute resources based on demand.
- **Elasticity**: The ability to acquire resources as you need them and release them when you don't.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Practice
- Launched a `t2.micro` EC2 instance (Free Tier eligible).
- Explored the EC2 dashboard and instance details.
