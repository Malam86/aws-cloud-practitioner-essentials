# Module 5: Networking on AWS

## 🔌 Introduction to Networking Components

### 🏠 Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)
**Meaning:** A virtual network dedicated to your AWS account that provides complete isolation and control over your networking environment. It's logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud.

**Key Concept:** Think of VPC as your own private section of the AWS cloud - like having your own personal data center within AWS.

**Real-World Example: Company Office Building**

Traditional Office Building vs AWS VPC:
├── Office Building │ ├── AWS VPC
│ ├── Security Guards │ │ ├── Security Groups & NACLs
│ ├── Private Offices │ │ ├── Private Subnets
│ ├── Reception Area │ │ ├── Public Subnets
│ ├── Internal Hallways │ │ ├── Route Tables
│ └── Building Entrance │ │ └── Internet Gateway

**Technical Example: E-commerce Application VPC**

Company: "ShopEasy" E-commerce Platform
VPC: shopeasy-vpc (10.0.0.0/16)
├── Contains: Web servers, application servers, databases
├── Isolation: Completely separate from other AWS customers
├── Control: Full control over IP ranges, subnets, routing
└── Security: Custom security groups and network ACLs

### 🌐 Subnets
**Meaning:** A range of IP addresses in your VPC that you can launch AWS resources into. Subnets allow you to segment your network for security and organization.

**Key Concept:** Subnets divide your VPC into smaller, manageable network segments, typically placed in different Availability Zones for high availability.

**Real-World Example: Office Building Floor Plan**

Office Building Floor Plan vs VPC Subnets:
├── Office Floor Plan │ ├── VPC Subnet Design
│ ├── Public Areas │ │ ├── Public Subnets
│ │ └── Reception │ │ │ └── Web servers
│ ├── Work Areas │ │ ├── Private Subnets
│ │ └── Employee desks │ │ │ └── App servers
│ └── Secure Areas │ │ ├── Isolated Subnets
│ └── Server room │ │ │ └── Databases

**Technical Example: Three-Tier Application Subnets**

VPC: 10.0.0.0/16
├── Public Subnets (Web Tier):
│ ├── 10.0.1.0/24 (us-east-1a) - Accepts internet traffic
│ └── 10.0.2.0/24 (us-east-1b) - Accepts internet traffic
├── Private Subnets (App Tier):
│ ├── 10.0.3.0/24 (us-east-1a) - No internet access
│ └── 10.0.4.0/24 (us-east-1b) - No internet access
└── Isolated Subnets (DB Tier):
├── 10.0.5.0/24 (us-east-1a) - Most restricted
└── 10.0.6.0/24 (us-east-1b) - Most restricted


## 📊 Understanding Connections Through Diagrams

### Public Subnet vs Private Subnet

**Public Subnet Meaning:**
A subnet that has a route to an Internet Gateway, allowing resources within it to communicate directly with the internet.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Has a route table entry: 0.0.0.0/0 → igw-xxxxx
- Resources can have public IP addresses
- Direct inbound/outbound internet access
- Typically used for load balancers, web servers, NAT gateways

**Private Subnet Meaning:**
A subnet that does NOT have a direct route to the internet. Resources in private subnets cannot be accessed directly from the internet.

**Key Characteristics:**
- No direct route to Internet Gateway
- Resources typically have only private IP addresses
- Can access internet through NAT Gateway (outbound only)
- Typically used for application servers, databases, internal services

🔗 Internet Gateway (routes to public subnet)
↓
🏢 Public Subnet - ALB (receives request)
↓
🔒 Private Subnet - App Server (processes request)
↓
🔒 Private Subnet - Database (fetches data)
↓
🔄 Response travels back through same path

**Private Subnet Internet Access:**

🔒 Private Subnet - App Server (needs to download updates)
↓
🌐 NAT Gateway in Public Subnet (translates private to public IP)
↓
🔗 Internet Gateway (connects to internet)
↓
🌐 External Update Server
↓
🔄 Response comes back through NAT Gateway


## 🎯 Key Differences: Public vs Private Subnets
