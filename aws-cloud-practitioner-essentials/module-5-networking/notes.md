# Module 5: Networking on AWS

## 🔌 Introduction to Networking Components

### 🏠 Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)
**Meaning:** A virtual network dedicated to your AWS account that provides complete isolation and control over your networking environment. It's logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud.

**Key Concept:** Think of VPC as your own private section of the AWS cloud - like having your own personal data center within AWS.

**Real-World Example: Company Office Building**

Traditional Office Building vs AWS VPC:
├── Office Building │ ├── AWS VPC
│ ├── Security Guards │ │ ├── Security Groups & NACLs
│ ├── Private Offices │ │ ├── Private Subnets
│ ├── Reception Area │ │ ├── Public Subnets
│ ├── Internal Hallways │ │ ├── Route Tables
│ └── Building Entrance │ │ └── Internet Gateway

**Technical Example: E-commerce Application VPC**

Company: "ShopEasy" E-commerce Platform
VPC: shopeasy-vpc (10.0.0.0/16)
├── Contains: Web servers, application servers, databases
├── Isolation: Completely separate from other AWS customers
├── Control: Full control over IP ranges, subnets, routing
└── Security: Custom security groups and network ACLs

### 🌐 Subnets
**Meaning:** A range of IP addresses in your VPC that you can launch AWS resources into. Subnets allow you to segment your network for security and organization.

**Key Concept:** Subnets divide your VPC into smaller, manageable network segments, typically placed in different Availability Zones for high availability.

**Real-World Example: Office Building Floor Plan**

Office Building Floor Plan vs VPC Subnets:
├── Office Floor Plan │ ├── VPC Subnet Design
│ ├── Public Areas │ │ ├── Public Subnets
│ │ └── Reception │ │ │ └── Web servers
│ ├── Work Areas │ │ ├── Private Subnets
│ │ └── Employee desks │ │ │ └── App servers
│ └── Secure Areas │ │ ├── Isolated Subnets
│ └── Server room │ │ │ └── Databases

**Technical Example: Three-Tier Application Subnets**

VPC: 10.0.0.0/16
├── Public Subnets (Web Tier):
│ ├── 10.0.1.0/24 (us-east-1a) - Accepts internet traffic
│ └── 10.0.2.0/24 (us-east-1b) - Accepts internet traffic
├── Private Subnets (App Tier):
│ ├── 10.0.3.0/24 (us-east-1a) - No internet access
│ └── 10.0.4.0/24 (us-east-1b) - No internet access
└── Isolated Subnets (DB Tier):
├── 10.0.5.0/24 (us-east-1a) - Most restricted
└── 10.0.6.0/24 (us-east-1b) - Most restricted


## 📊 Understanding Connections Through Diagrams

### Public Subnet vs Private Subnet

## 🛡️ Subnets, Security Groups, and Network ACLs

### 🌐 Subnets

**What are Subnets?**
- A section of a VPC for grouping resources based on security or operational needs
- You can group resources together based on what they do or how secure they need to be

**Two Types of Subnets:**
- **Public Subnets:** For resources that need to be accessible by the public
  - Example: Online store's website
- **Private Subnets:** For resources that should only be accessible through your private network
  - Example: Database with customer personal information

**How They Work Together:**

VPC with Internet Gateway
├── Public Subnet
│ ├── EC2 Instance (Web Server)
│ └── EC2 Instance (Web Server)
└── Private Subnet
├── Database (Customer Data)
└── Database (Order History)


**Real-World Example:**
- Web servers in public subnet talk to databases in private subnet
- Customers can access web servers, but not databases directly

### 🚦 Network Traffic in a VPC

**What is Network Traffic?**
- Movement of data packets traveling across a network
- When you request data from an AWS application, your request is sent as a "packet"

**Packet Journey:**

Customer Request → Internet → Internet Gateway → Network ACL Check → Subnet → Resources


**Key Point:** Every packet must pass permission checks before entering or leaving a subnet

### 🛂 Network ACLs (Network Access Control Lists)

**What are Network ACLs?**
- Virtual firewall that controls traffic at the SUBNET level
- Like a passport control officer at the airport

**How They Work:**
- Check every packet entering AND leaving a subnet
- Use rules to decide: "Allow" or "Deny"
- **Stateless:** They don't remember previous packets (check every time)

**Default vs Custom Network ACLs:**
- **Default Network ACL:** Allows all traffic (like "Everyone is welcome")
- **Custom Network ACL:** Denies all traffic until you add allow rules (like "Custom guest list")

**Airport Analogy:**

Traveler (Packet) → Passport Control (Network ACL) → Country (Subnet)

1. Officer checks credentials when entering AND exiting
2. Doesn't remember you from previous trips

### 🏢 Security Groups

**What are Security Groups?**
- Virtual firewall that controls traffic at the RESOURCE level (like EC2 instances)
- Like a door attendant at an apartment building

**How They Work:**
- Check packets for specific resources (EC2 instances)
- **Stateful:** They remember previous decisions

**Default Behavior:**
- **Inbound Traffic:** Denied by default (like "No visitors allowed")
- **Outbound Traffic:** Allowed by default (like "Residents can leave freely")

**Apartment Building Analogy:**

Guest (Packet) → Door Attendant (Security Group) → Apartment (EC2 Instance)

1. Attendant checks list when guests arrive
2. Doesn't check when guests leave
3. Remembers residents and their guests


### ⚖️ Security Groups vs Network ACLs Comparison

| Feature | Security Groups | Network ACLs |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Scope** | Instance level (protects EC2) | Subnet level (protects entire subnet) |
| **State** | Stateful (remembers) | Stateless (forgets) |
| **Rule Types** | Allow rules only | Allow AND Deny rules |
| **Return Traffic** | Automatically allowed | Must be explicitly allowed |
| **Best For** | Fine control of individual instances | Broad control of subnet traffic |

### 🔄 How They Work Together

**Complete Security Picture:**

Internet → Internet Gateway → Network ACL (Subnet Level) → Security Group (Instance Level) → EC2 Instance


**Real-World Flow:**
1. Packet arrives from internet
2. Network ACL checks: "Can this enter the subnet?"
3. Security Group checks: "Can this access the specific EC2 instance?"
4. If both allow, packet reaches the instance

### 🎯 Key Takeaways

**Network ACLs:**
- First line of defense for entire subnet
- Check packets entering AND leaving
- Don't remember previous packets
- Can explicitly allow or deny

**Security Groups:**
- Final defense for individual instances
- Remember allowed connections
- Only use allow rules (everything else denied)
- Automatically allow return traffic

**Shared Responsibility:**
- **AWS Responsibility:** Security OF the cloud (infrastructure)
- **Your Responsibility:** Security IN the cloud (Network ACLs and Security Groups)

**Best Practice:** Use both together for layered security - Network ACLs for broad protection, Security Groups for fine-grained control.

## 🌐 Global Networking: Edge Services

### 🎯 What is Edge Networking?
**Meaning:** Bringing computing and data storage closer to the users who need it, instead of keeping everything in one central location.

**Why It Matters:**
- **Faster loading times** - content doesn't have to travel as far
- **Better user experience** - less waiting, more responsive
- **More control** - you decide where your data is stored

**Real-World Example:**

Without Edge Networking:
User in Tokyo → Request travels to US → Content comes back from US → Slow

With Edge Networking:
User in Tokyo → Tokyo Edge Location → Fast response


### 📞 DNS: The Internet's Phone Book

**What is DNS?**
- **DNS = Domain Name System**
- Translates website names (like amazon.com) to IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1)
- Like looking up a phone number in a contacts list

**How DNS Works:**

You type: "amazon.com" → DNS translates to → "192.0.2.1" → You connect to website


### 🚀 Amazon Route 53

**What is Route 53?**
- AWS's DNS service that routes users to your applications
- Like a super-smart GPS for internet traffic

**Key Features:**
- **Global DNS servers** - fast worldwide
- **Automatic scaling** - handles any amount of traffic
- **Domain management** - buy and manage domains in one place

**How It Helps:**

User requests your website → Route 53 finds best location → User connects quickly


### 📦 Amazon CloudFront (CDN)
